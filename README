Overview
=================================
ByteCart is a bukkit plugin that allows to create a railed network using principle of Internet.

ByteCart provides a set of blocks to create routers and stations according to a predefined network topology.
It allows the connection of 45000 stations in 53 regions.

Routing tables are stored ingame using a innovative information storage technology using chests. There is no database.

For the moment, routing tables configuration is manual, but future evolution of the plugin will allow automatic
filling of routing tables.

Bukkit version
=================================
This version of ByteCart runs on Minecraft v1.2.3 and later. Since Bukkit API changed for version 1.2, there is no
compatibility with versions of Minecraft prior to 1.2. 

Features
=================================
* Minimum CPU and memory usage, even with a huge network.
ByteCart is fully scalable, meaning that whatever the size of your network, the same amount of resources are used
to take a cart from one point to another.

* Well-known pathfinding algorithm
ByteCart implements Djikstra algorithm as used in Internet routing protocol, with the success we know. All paths
are precomputed and stored in routing tables. finding the best path is only a read operation on routing tables.

* Support Permissions API. Check plugin.yml for available permissions.

* WorldEdit compatibility
Since there is no external data storage, all world editing tools are compatible with Bytecart, but, in case of copy/paste
operation, you need to manually update network address on signs.

* Falsebook and Minecart revolution compatibility

Installation
=================================
Drop ByteCart.jar into the bukkit plugin directory. It will create its own configuration file with
default configuration options.
